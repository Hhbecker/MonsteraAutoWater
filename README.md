# MonsteraAutoWater


Start doing this for one plant only then expand if cost is low enough.


### Objectives 
* get a sensor for dirt mosture that connects to arduino
* get a power controlled water valve that connects to an arduino
* take data on dirt mositure every 6 hours and send data to a text file on my laptop
* get arduino to turn on water valve when dirt moisture reaches threshold dryness
* include an LED that lights up when water is low
* set dryness thresholds specific to the type of plant (monstera vs fern)


### Questions 
Can you get arduino to perform operations in time intervals?


### Arduino fast facts 
* good for controlling electronic components and nothing else
* can control lights, motors, sensors, and wireless and bluetooth stuff
* good platform for building robots
* has a microcontroller not a microprocessor
* powered by 9 volt batteries 
* arduinos come in all different shapes and sizes so you can get a bigger or smaller one depending on your project 
* they make “shields” which can connect to the arduino to give it bluetooth, cellular, ethernet, etc functionality 
* Uses a Arduino language similar to C++


### Arduino Workflow
1. write code to program the arduino microcontroller telling it what to do
2. Connect the arduino to a computer to load the code onto the arduino
3. Disconnect the arduino from the computer and use it
